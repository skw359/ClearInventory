# ClearInventory
This is a small plugin to clear your inventory upon request, nothing fancy :)

Compatible versions: 1.8-1.16.5
By default, you can't use it. Negate the permission clearinventory.use to true!

Yes, this is my first project so you're welcome to look at it and do whatever you wish. I'm open to feedback, pull requests, etc. 

All in all, thank you for downloading and I hope you enjoy!
