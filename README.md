# ClearInventory
This is a small plugin to clear your inventory, nothing fancy :)

Works on about every Minecraft version above 1.8+, not likely to break with updates

Permission node: clearinventory.use

As you may have guessed, this is my first project, given the simplicity of it. Feel free to create a pull request, issues, etc. 

All in all, thank you for downloading and I hope you enjoy!
